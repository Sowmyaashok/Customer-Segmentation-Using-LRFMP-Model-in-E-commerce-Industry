# Master thesis - Customer segmentation using LRMFP model in e-commerce industry

Participants : Sowmya Ashok Kumar. Lipika Chakravarti

Supervised By : Muhammad Afzaal, PHD, Stockholm University (https://github.com/muhammadafzaal)

Summary:
The research focuses on implementing customer segmentation using the LRFMP model and advanced clustering techniques in e-commerce. Two datasets, UK Online Retail and H&M Online Retail, are analyzed to study the impact of dataset volume on model selection. The results reveal effective clustering using RM with K-means and Agglomerative algorithms for the UK dataset, and RL with K-means and BIRCH algorithms for the H&M dataset. Including L and P variables in the RFM model doesn't consistently improve clustering outcomes, indicating variable influence based on dataset characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights for personalized marketing and improved customer engagement in e-commerce.

**H&M Online Retail Datset**
 
Based on the customer segmentation results summarized in the table below, it is evident that RL model emerged as the most effective model showing the best score which is a high SI score and a low DB score. These findings highlight the superiority of the RL model in accurately segmenting the customers. K-means and BIRCH clusterimg exhibits good performance.

**UK Online Retail Datset**

Based on the customer segmentation results summarized in the table below, it is evident that RM model emerged as the most effective model showing the best score which is a high SI score and a low DB score. These findings highlight the superiority of the RM model in accurately segmenting the customers. K-means and agglomerative clusterimg exhibits good performance.
